Downloading and Visualizing NYISO Actual Load and Forecast Data
===============================================================

This repository contains a set of Python scripts used to massively download, organize and plot. 

Examples of the use of the scripts are found in the Jupyter Notebook `01_Examples.ipynb`. For quick reference, the regions of the New York State grid are:

- `CAPITL`
- `CENTRL`
- `DUNWOD`
- `GENESE`
- `HUD VL`
- `LONGIL`
- `MHK VL`
- `MILLWD`
- `N.Y.C.` (be careful with the last colon after the 'C')
- `NORTH`
- `WEST`

In old files (prior to 2004), `NYC` and `LONGIL` were lumped into a single area: `N.Y.C._LONGIL`. The visualization function might not work in such cases.

Below is a list of the signatures of the functions in the repository:

- `download_nyiso_data(start_year, destination_folder, print_info = False)`: this function downloads all the '.csv' files of load forecast and actual load (hourly time-stamp) from the NYISO website from a given start year up to present time. It can be used to update existing files (i.e., does not overwrite pre-existing data). It also organizes the files in Pandas dataframes stored as pickle files (.pkl) by region of the New York State grid.

- `visualize_load_forecast(date, region, data_path)`: this function plots the actual load, load forecast and forecast error of the given date using the processed pickle files created by `download_nyiso_data`. As an optional return value, it gives the time stamps, the actual load and the forecast values. 

The plots generated by the provided notebook are stored under "00_NYISO_Data/Figs" as '.png' files.
